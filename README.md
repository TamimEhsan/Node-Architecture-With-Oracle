# Node-Architecture

This is aimed to create a basic architecture for data flow in nodejs.

The structure is separated in several layers.

Some major functionality that is implemented now is

- Router
- Passport Authentication
- Validation middlewares (Not included in this one)
- Controller
- Service (Didn;t use in this project)
- Repository 
- Oracle Database Connection


## Data Flow

### Router

- At first http request is accepeted from app.js and routed to route/api.js
- There it is passed to whatever path it is

### Authentication
Router here checks if the user is authorized or not. It filters all the api calls in api route

### Validation
Validation middleware validates and sanitized the user input to minimize security risks. Not included in this project

### Controller

- The main/business logic is implemented is controller layer
- It asks for data from service layer (But for this straight from repository)

### Service
Not included
- Service layer implements all logic related to sql queries
- But it doesn't fetch the data itself

### Repository
- Repository is where the query is executed and served
- Redis or Node Caching is done here (Not included)
